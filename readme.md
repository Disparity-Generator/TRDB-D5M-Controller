| G_FIFO_PARALLEL_DATA        | std_logic                 | '0'     | When set, pixels will be sent through the output FIFO before being sent off chip.  This allows the output port to be running at a slower speed than f_PIXCLK,  since the FIFO allows for pixels to be output during horizontal blank.  Use of this mode requires the PLL to be set up properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Positive values shift PIXCLK later in time relative to D  (and thus relative to the internal array/datapath clock).  No effect unless PIXCLK is divided by Divide Pixel Clock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| G_DIVIDE_PIXEL_CLOCK        | integer range 0 to 64     | 0       | Produces a PIXCLK that is divided by the value times two.  The value must be zero or a power of 2.

Setting this to a positive number will correct by that much  less than the delta value. A negative number will correct by more  (possibly worsening the overshoot).  This applies to the magnitude of the delta, so a positive damping value will be subtracted  from a positive delta and added to a negative delta.                                                                                                             |

If the average black value for a color  is higher than this value times 4 or lower than BLC_Low_Delta_Threshold times 4,  the fast sampling and binary search modes will be activated (if enabled).  Once the black level is between the BLC_High_Delta_Threshold and the BLC_Low_Delta_Threshold,  the delta adjustment mode will be used (though fast sample mode will continue until the end of the frame).  This value should be set no lower than BLC High Target Threshold. |

| G_BLC_HIGH_TARGET_THRESHOLD | integer range 0 to 127    | 35      | The upper target threshold of the BLC algorithm divided by 4.  The target black value is 4 times the average of the BLC_High_Target_Threshold  and the BLC_Low_Target_Threshold.
